Answer: Liquid Web, L.L.C

**Task 8:**

Is the site a scam? It is worth considering how much time and effort that goes into setting up a PBN. A PBN ideally has a minimum of 50 pages of unique, natural-sounding and on-topic articles. That's a lot of time and effort that went into getting a fast, short-term bump in the rankings, rather than into other aspects of the business, or even something as simple and affordable as pay-per-click marketing.

On the other hand, you might be surprised to learn just how common it is for websites to hire SEO agencies. Some of these agencies, whether they admit it or not, have hundreds of PBNs and a staff of writers (usually offshore) pumping out content designed solely for the consumption of the search algorithms.
