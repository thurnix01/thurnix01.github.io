Answer: 4

2.	Which layer checks received packets to make sure that they haven't been corrupted?
Answer: 2

3.	In which layer would data be formatted in preparation for transmission?
Answer: 2

4.	Which layer transmits and receives data?
Answer: 1

5.	Which layer encrypts, compresses, or otherwise transforms the initial data to give it a standardized format?
Answer: 6

6.	Which layer tracks communications between the host and receiving computers?
Answer: 5

7.	Which layer accepts communication requests from applications?
Answer: 7

8.	Which layer handles logical addressing?
Answer: 3

9.	When sending data over TCP, what would you call the "bite-sized" pieces of data?
Answer: segments

10.	[Research] Which layer would the FTP protocol communicate with?
Answer: 7

11.	Which transport layer protocol would be best suited to transmit a live video?
Answer: UDP



Task 3:

12.	How would you refer to data at layer 2 of the encapsulation process (with the OSI model)?
Answer: Frames

13.	How would you refer to data at layer 4 of the encapsulation process (with the OSI model), if the UDP protocol has been selected?
Answer: Datagrams

14.	What process would a computer perform on a received message?
Answer: De-encapsulation

15.	Which is the only layer of the OSI model to add a trailer during encapsulation?
Answer: Data Link

Answer: Aye



Task 4:

17.	Which model was introduced first, OSI or TCP/IP?
Answer: TCP/IP

18.	Which layer of the TCP/IP model covers the functionality of the Transport layer of the OSI model (Full Name)?
Answer: Transport

19.	Which layer of the TCP/IP model covers the functionality of the Session layer of the OSI model (Full Name)?
Answer: Application

20.	The Network Interface layer of the TCP/IP model covers the functionality of two layers in the OSI model. These layers are Data Link, and?.. (Full Name)?
Answer: Physical

21.	Which layer of the TCP/IP model handles the functionality of the OSI network layer?
Answer: Internet
