Encryption - Crypto 101

Answer the questions below

I agree not to complain too much about how theory heavy this room is.
•	No answer needed

Are SSH keys protected with a passphrase or a password?
•	When I looked up the question, I found this useful:

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/gcm-ssh-passphrase?view=azure-devops#:~:text=SSH%20uses%20private%2Fpublic%20key,to%20copy%20your%20private%20key.

 
Answer: Passphrase



What does SSH stand for?
•	Secure Shell (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell/)

How do webservers prove their identity?
•	Authentication by use of certificates proves webservers identity
